## I. Introduction

**Motivation:** 

This paper is dedicated to the memory of my grandma.

This is probably the only paper in my life that was written in a hospital the entire time. This is at the same time probably the only work in my life that is publicly available on preprint platform arXiv, not submitted to a formal journal, but open-sourced. It's a very unique idea. Think of it as a crazy burn for the field I've been fighting for nearly $5$ years during my PhD carrier.
