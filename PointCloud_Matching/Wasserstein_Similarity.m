%
% Information:
% This function computes the 2-Wasserstein distance between two 2D point clouds
% represented as 2xN and 2xM matrices, where the first dimension represents the
% 2D coordinates and the second dimension represents the number of points.
% The Wasserstein distance is computed using the linear programming formulation
% of the optimal transport problem, with the cost being the squared Euclidean
% distance between points. The point clouds are treated as empirical uniform
% distributions, with masses 1/N and 1/M for each point in the respective clouds.
%
% Inputs:
%   pointCloud1 - 2xN matrix representing the first point cloud.
%   pointCloud2 - 2xM matrix representing the second point cloud.
%
% Outputs:
%   similarity - scalar representing the 2-Wasserstein distance between the two point clouds.
